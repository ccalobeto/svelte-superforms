# Project
This project use shadcn superforms and nodemailer to send emails.

## What i've done
- Build the form using superforms and shadcn-svelte.
- Use nodemailer to send emails.
- The form interacts with the server and is not working in github pages because of static sites.
- I still can't send mails with nodemailer and gmail.
